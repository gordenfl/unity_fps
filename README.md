# 🎮 Unity3D Single-Player 3D Game Demo

## Overview
This project is a fully functional **single-player 3D game demo built with Unity3D**.  
It was created to explore Unity’s workflow and to understand how modern 3D games handle character control, animation, effects, audio, and scene composition.  
The demo includes a playable character, interactive environment, visual effects, sound design, and basic game logic.

**Technologies:** Unity 3D, C#, URP, Animator Controller, Timeline, NavMesh, Particle System, Audio Mixer  
**Role:** Solo Developer
